# **UNIT 2: Tools and Methods Used in Cybercrime**

## **1. Phishing and Identity Theft**

### **1.1 Phishing**

#### **Definition:**

Phishing is a cybercrime technique where attackers impersonate legitimate entities to deceive individuals into revealing sensitive information such as login credentials, credit card details, or personal information through fraudulent emails, websites, or messages.

#### **Features/Process of Phishing:**

- Deceptive messages that appear to be from trusted sources.
- Use of fake websites mimicking legitimate services.
- Psychological manipulation to create urgency (e.g., account suspension warnings).
- Harvesting sensitive data for identity theft or financial fraud.

#### **Types of Phishing Scams:**

1. **Email Phishing:** Fraudulent emails with links to fake websites.
2. **Vishing (Voice Phishing):** Attackers use phone calls to extract sensitive information.
3. **Smishing (SMS Phishing):** Fraudulent SMS messages containing malicious links.
4. **Clone Phishing:** Replicating a legitimate email but with a malicious link.
5. **Pharming:** Redirecting users to fake websites through DNS poisoning.

### **1.2 Methods of Phishing**

1. **Deceptive Phishing:** Sending emails pretending to be a legitimate organization.
2. **Malware-Based Phishing:** Distributing malware through attachments or downloads.
3. **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Phishing:** Intercepting communication between a user and a service to steal credentials.
4. **Search Engine Phishing:** Fake websites appearing in search results to deceive users.

### **1.3 Spear Phishing**

#### **Definition:**

Spear phishing is a targeted phishing attack aimed at a specific individual or organization, often using personalized information to appear more convincing.

#### **Features:**

- Highly personalized messages.
- Exploits trust relationships.
- Often used in corporate espionage or advanced persistent threats (APTs).

### **1.4 Phishing Toolkits and Spy Phishing**

#### **Phishing Toolkits:**

Phishing toolkits are pre-packaged sets of software tools that enable attackers to create phishing attacks easily.

#### **Spy Phishing:**

Spy phishing involves using spyware or keyloggers to secretly collect user credentials and personal data.

## **2. Identity Theft**

### **2.1 Personally Identifiable Information (PII)**

#### **Definition:**

Personally Identifiable Information (PII) refers to any information that can be used to identify an individual.

#### **Types of PII:**

- **Sensitive PII:** Social Security Number, credit card details, medical records.
- **Non-sensitive PII:** Name, address, phone number (can be used for social engineering).

### **2.2 Types and Techniques of Identity Theft**

1. **Financial Identity Theft:** Stealing credit card or bank information.
2. **Medical Identity Theft:** Using someone’s medical details for healthcare fraud.
3. **Criminal Identity Theft:** Using someone’s identity when arrested for crimes.
4. **Synthetic Identity Theft:** Creating a fake identity using stolen data.

#### **Techniques Used:**

- **Dumpster Diving:** Retrieving personal details from discarded documents.
- **Skimming:** Capturing credit card data via hidden devices.
- **Social Engineering:** Manipulating individuals to divulge confidential data.

## **3. Password Cracking**

### **Definition:**

Password cracking is the process of recovering passwords from stored or transmitted data using various techniques.

### **Methods of Password Cracking:**

1. **Brute Force Attack:** Trying every possible combination until the password is found.
2. **Dictionary Attack:** Using a pre-compiled list of common passwords.
3. **Rainbow Table Attack:** Using precomputed hash values to find matches.
4. **Credential Stuffing:** Using stolen credentials from previous data breaches.

## **4. Keyloggers and Spyware**

### **4.1 Keyloggers**

#### **Definition:**

A keylogger is a malicious software or hardware that records keystrokes to steal passwords, messages, and other sensitive data.

### **4.2 Spyware**

#### **Definition:**

Spyware is a type of malware that secretly collects user information without their consent.

## **5. Backdoors**

### **Definition:**

A backdoor is a hidden method of bypassing normal authentication to gain unauthorized access to a system.

### **Types of Backdoors:**

1. **Hardware Backdoors:** Embedded in computer chips or firmware.
2. **Software Backdoors:** Hidden within applications or operating systems.
3. **Remote Access Trojans (RATs):** Malware that allows remote control over a device.

---

## **6. Steganography**

### **Definition:**

Steganography is the practice of concealing messages or data within other non-suspicious digital media, such as images, videos, or audio files.

### **Methods of Steganography:**

1. **Image Steganography:** Hiding data within image pixels.
2. **Audio Steganography:** Embedding messages in sound files.
3. **Video Steganography:** Concealing data in video frames.
4. **Text Steganography:** Using invisible characters or encoding text.

## **7. Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks**

### **7.1 DoS Attack**

#### **Definition:**

A DoS attack floods a system, server, or network with excessive traffic, making it unavailable to users.

### **7.2 DDoS Attack**

#### **Definition:**

A DDoS attack uses multiple compromised computers (botnets) to perform a large-scale DoS attack.

### **Types of DDoS Attacks:**

1. **Volumetric Attacks:** Overloading bandwidth with traffic.
2. **Protocol Attacks:** Exploiting weaknesses in network protocols.
3. **Application-Layer Attacks:** Targeting web applications with malicious requests.

---

## **8. SQL Injection**

### **Definition:**

SQL Injection is a web attack technique where malicious SQL queries are inserted into input fields to manipulate the database.

### **Types of SQL Injection:**

1. **Classic SQL Injection:** Directly inserting malicious SQL code.
2. **Blind SQL Injection:** Extracting data by observing responses.
3. **Union-Based SQL Injection:** Using the `UNION` SQL operator to retrieve data.

---

## **9. Buffer Overflow**

### **Definition:**

A buffer overflow occurs when a program writes more data into a buffer than it can hold, leading to memory corruption and potential execution of malicious code.

### **Types of Buffer Overflow:**

1. **Stack Overflow:** Overwriting return addresses in the stack.
2. **Heap Overflow:** Corrupting dynamically allocated memory.
