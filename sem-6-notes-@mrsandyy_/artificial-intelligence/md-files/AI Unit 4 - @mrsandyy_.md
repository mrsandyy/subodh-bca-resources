# UNIT IV: Artificial Intelligence and Expert System

## 1. Concept of Learning

### 1.1 Definition

Learning in AI is the **process by which an agent improves its performance** at tasks over time, by acquiring knowledge or skills from data, experience, or interaction, without being explicitly re-programmed for each scenario.

---

### 1.2 Types of Learning

#### 1.2.1 Supervised Learning

- **Definition:** Learns a mapping from inputs to outputs using labeled examples.

- **Process:**
  
  1. **Training Phase:** Feed (input, correct output) pairs to a learning algorithm.
  
  2. **Model Construction:** Adjust internal parameters to minimize error.
  
  3. **Testing Phase:** Validate on unseen inputs to measure generalization.

- **Examples:** Linear regression, decision trees, support vector machines.

#### 1.2.2 Unsupervised Learning

- **Definition:** Discovers patterns or groupings in unlabeled data.

- **Process:**
  
  1. **Cluster Analysis:** Group similar data points (e.g., K-means).
  
  2. **Dimensionality Reduction:** Find latent structure (e.g., PCA).

- **Examples:** Market segmentation, anomaly detection.

#### 1.2.3 Reinforcement Learning

- **Definition:** Learns by **trial-and-error**, receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.

- **Process:**
  
  1. **Agent–Environment Loop:** Agent takes action → environment returns reward + new state.
  
  2. **Policy Update:** Agent updates strategy to maximize cumulative reward.

- **Examples:** Game playing (AlphaGo), robotic control.

| **Instance-based**  | Memorizes training instances          | k-Nearest Neighbors        |
| **Model-based**     | Builds a global model                 | Linear/Logistic Regression |

### 1.4 Advantages & Limitations

- **Advantages:**
  
  - Adaptability to new data
  
  - Can uncover complex patterns

- **Limitations:**
  
  - Requires large, high-quality datasets
  
  - Risk of overfitting or underfitting

## 2. Knowledge Acquisition

### 2.1 Definition

The **process of gathering** domain expertise and transforming it into a formal knowledge base for AI systems.

---

### 2.2 Methods of Acquisition

1. **Manual Elicitation**
   
   - **Interviews & Workshops** with domain experts
   
   - **Protocol Analysis:** Experts think aloud while solving problems

2. **Automated Extraction**
   
   - **Text Mining:** Parsing manuals, reports
   
   - **Machine Learning:** Inducing rules from historical data

3. **Mixed-Mode**
   
   - **Interactive Tools** (e.g., knowledge editors) that blend expert input with automated suggestions

---

### 2.3 Knowledge Engineering Cycle

1. **Feasibility Study:** Assess problem complexity, ROI

2. **Knowledge Elicitation:** Capture raw expertise

3. **Knowledge Modeling:** Choose representation (rules, frames, ontologies)

4. **Implementation:** Populate knowledge base

5. **Verification & Validation:** Test against real cases

6. **Maintenance:** Update as domain evolves

---

## 3. Rote Learning

### 3.1 Definition

Storing exact facts or examples in memory without inference or generalization.

---

### 3.2 Process & Characteristics

- **Memorization:** Facts are added verbatim to the knowledge base.

- **Recall:** System matches input to stored facts for retrieval.

| Pros                          | Cons                             |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Simple to implement           | No ability to handle novel cases |
| Fast lookup for exact matches | Knowledge base grows quickly     |
| Predictable behavior          | Zero inferential power           |

## 4. Discovery

### 4.1 Definition

Automatic or semi-automatic **generation of new knowledge** (rules, patterns) from data or by exploring model behavior.

---

### 4.2 Approaches

- **Rule Induction:** Generate IF–THEN rules from data (e.g., Quinlan’s C4.5).

- **Genetic Algorithms:** Evolve rule sets by selection/crossover/mutation.

- **Clustering & Outlier Analysis:** Identify novel groupings or anomalies.

---

### 4.3 Example: Rule Induction Workflow

1. **Select Candidate Attributes**

2. **Partition Data** (e.g., decision tree splits)

3. **Formulate Rules** from leaves

4. **Prune** to remove over-specific rules

---

## 5. Analogy

### 5.1 Definition

Problem-solving by **mapping** structures or relationships from a known domain (source) to a new domain (target).

---

### 5.2 Structure-Mapping Theory (Gentner)

- **Base Domain:** Known situation with relational structure.

- **Target Domain:** New situation to be understood or solved.

- **Mapping:** Identify correspondences between base and target entities.

---

### 5.3 Example

- **Source:** Solar system (Sun-planets orbits)

- **Target:** Atom (Nucleus-electrons orbits)

By analogy, infer electron orbits behave like planetary orbits.
