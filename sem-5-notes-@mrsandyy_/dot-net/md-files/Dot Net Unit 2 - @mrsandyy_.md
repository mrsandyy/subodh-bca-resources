## 6. Working with Events

### 6.1 Definition

In ASP.NET, events are actions or occurrences, such as a button click or a page load, that can trigger the execution of specific server-side code. Events allow developers to create interactive and dynamic web applications by responding to user actions.

### 6.2 Exam Answer

**What is "Working with Events" in ASP.NET?**  
Working with events in ASP.NET involves handling user-triggered actions, such as clicking a button or selecting an item from a dropdown, using event handlers. The ASP.NET framework provides a robust event-driven model that ensures efficient management of these interactions, allowing developers to execute server-side logic in response to user inputs.

### 6.3 Features of Event Handling in ASP.NET

- **Server-Side Execution**: Event handling logic is executed on the server.
- **Built-In Events**: A wide range of pre-defined events like `Click`, `Load`, `SelectedIndexChanged`, etc.
- **Customizable**: Developers can create custom events.
- **Event Bubbling**: Events propagate from child to parent controls.
- **Integration with Web Controls**: Most server controls come with built-in event support.

### 6.4 Common Events in ASP.NET

1. **Page Events**: Triggered during the lifecycle of a web page.
   - `Page_Load`: Executed when the page is loaded.
   - `Page_PreRender`: Executed just before the page is rendered to the client.
2. **Control Events**: Triggered by user interaction with server controls.
   - `Button.Click`: Occurs when a button is clicked.
   - `TextBox.TextChanged`: Occurs when the text in a TextBox changes.

### 6.5 Example: Handling a Button Click Event

**ASPX Markup**

```html
<asp:Button ID="Button1" runat="server" Text="Click Me" OnClick="Button1_Click" />
```

**Code-Behind (C#)**

```csharp
protected void Button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    Response.Write("Button was clicked!");
}
```

When the button is clicked, the `Button1_Click` method executes, displaying a message on the page.

### 6.6 Advantages of Event Handling

- **Encapsulated Logic**: Keeps user interaction logic separate from presentation.
- **Reusability**: Event handlers can be reused across multiple controls.
- **Dynamic Interaction**: Enables the creation of interactive applications.

### 6.7 Disadvantages of Event Handling

- **Increased Server Load**: Each event triggers a server round trip.
- **Complexity in Debugging**: Debugging event-driven applications can be challenging due to multiple handlers.
