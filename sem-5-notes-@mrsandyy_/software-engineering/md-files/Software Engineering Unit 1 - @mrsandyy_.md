#### 3. **User Interface (UI)**:

The part of the software that interacts with the user. A good UI ensures that users can easily perform tasks and access the software's functionalities.

#### 4. **Data Storage**:

The software typically requires data storage for information to be retained, retrieved, and processed. This may involve databases, file systems, or other storage mechanisms.

#### 5. **Networking Components**:

For software that requires communication with other systems or over the internet, networking components are crucial for facilitating data transfer and connectivity.
