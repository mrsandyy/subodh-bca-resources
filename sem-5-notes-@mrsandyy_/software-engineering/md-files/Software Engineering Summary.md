  - **Basic COCOMO:** Provides a quick, rough estimate based on project size (small, medium, large).
  
  - **Intermediate COCOMO:** Factors in project attributes like reliability, team experience, and tools used.
  
  - **Detailed COCOMO:** Incorporates all attributes along with the detailed design and development phases for precise estimation.

- **Applications:** Helps in budgeting, resource planning, and decision-making for project feasibility.

  - Can be adapted to different project types and sizes.

- **Disadvantages:**
  
  - Requires accurate size estimation (KLOC), which can be difficult in early stages of development.
  
  - Assumes that all projects can be estimated using similar parameters, which may not always be true.

- **Principles of Testing:**
  - Testing shows the presence of defects, not their absence.
  - Early testing reduces the cost of finding and fixing defects.
  - Testing is context-dependent and must adapt to different project needs.
  - Exhaustive testing is impossible; focus on risk areas.
  - Defects cluster in specific areas, so prioritize high-risk or complex modules.

## Testing Strategies

- **Verification vs. Validation:**
  
  - **Verification:** Ensures the product is being built correctly according to design specifications.
