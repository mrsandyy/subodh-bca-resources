### **1. Raster Graphics Algorithms**

Raster graphics algorithms are used to represent and manipulate shapes on raster devices (pixel-based displays). These algorithms work by selecting the appropriate pixels to create geometric shapes like lines, circles, and polygons.

#### **1.1 Line Drawing Algorithms**

**Importance**:  
Line drawing algorithms are used to approximate straight lines on raster displays, which are inherently grid-like. These algorithms ensure smooth and accurate rendering.

**1.1.1 Digital Differential Analyzer (DDA) Algorithm**

- **Definition**:  
  The DDA algorithm is an incremental scan-conversion method that calculates intermediate points to draw a line.
- **Key Points**:
  - Uses floating-point arithmetic, making it simple but slower.
  - Steps involve calculating the difference between the endpoints, determining the number of steps, and plotting points incrementally.
- **Advantages**: Easy to implement.
- **Disadvantages**: Inefficient due to floating-point operations.

**1.1.2 Bresenhamâ€™s Line Algorithm**

- **Definition**:  
  A faster algorithm that uses only integer calculations to decide which pixel to illuminate.
- **Key Points**:
  - Based on the concept of an error term to determine the closest pixel.
  - Efficient and widely used in computer graphics.
- **Advantages**: Faster and more accurate than DDA.
- **Disadvantages**: More complex to implement.

#### **1.2 Circle and Ellipse Drawing Algorithms**

**Purpose**:  
To draw circles and ellipses accurately by using their mathematical properties and exploiting symmetry.

**1.2.1 Midpoint Circle Algorithm**

- **Definition**:  
  Determines the pixels closest to a circle's boundary using a decision parameter.
- **Key Features**:
  - Uses symmetry to reduce calculations.
  - Efficient integer-based calculations.

**1.2.2 Ellipse Drawing Algorithm**

- **Definition**:  
  Extends the midpoint algorithm to handle ellipses using the general ellipse equation.
- **Key Points**:
  - Divides calculations into two regions for efficiency.
  - Mirrors points across axes to complete the ellipse.

#### **1.3 Filling Algorithms**

**Purpose**:  
Filling algorithms are used to color the interior of shapes, such as polygons or regions bounded by curves.

**1.3.1 Scan-Conversion Polygon Filling**

- **Definition**:  
  Processes horizontal scan lines to determine which pixels lie inside a polygon.

**1.3.2 Inside-Outside Test**

- **Definition**:  
  Determines whether a point lies inside a polygon by extending a ray and counting edge intersections.

**1.3.3 Boundary Fill Algorithm**

- **Definition**:  
  Recursively fills a region until a boundary color is encountered.

**1.3.4 Flood Fill Algorithm**

- **Definition**:  
  Recursively fills all connected pixels of a specified color.

### **2. Transformations**

Transformations are operations that change the position, size, orientation, or shape of graphical objects. They are essential in computer graphics for modeling and rendering.

---

#### **2.1 2D Transformations**

2D transformations manipulate objects within a 2D plane. These include:

- **Translation**: Moves an object by a certain distance.
- **Rotation**: Rotates an object around a point by an angle.
- **Reflection**: Produces a mirror image of an object.
- **Shearing**: Skews the shape in horizontal or vertical directions.
- **Scaling**: Changes the size of an object proportionally or non-proportionally.

**Mathematical Representation**:  
Transformations are represented using mathematical formulas for and coordinates. For example:

- Translation:  

- Rotation:

#### **2.2 Homogeneous Coordinate Representation**

**Definition**:  
Homogeneous coordinates introduce an extra coordinate to simplify the representation of transformations as matrix operations.

**Advantages**:

- Allows multiple transformations to be combined into a single matrix.
- Simplifies the implementation of complex transformations.

Example (Translation):

#### **2.3 3D Transformations**

3D transformations extend the concepts of 2D transformations into three dimensions, adding the -coordinate.

- **Translation**: Moves an object in , , and directions.  

- **Scaling**: Changes the size in all three dimensions.

- **Rotation**: Rotates around one of the three axes (, , ).
