  - *"Developed at Xerox PARC in the 1970s, Popularized by Apple with the Macintosh in 1984, Became widespread with Microsoft Windows in the 1990s"*
- **Color Models:** Represent colors mathematically for digital displays.
  - **RGB:** Additive model using red, green, and blue as primary colors. "All other colours are produced by the proportional ratio of these three colours only." widely used in displays and digital imaging.
  - **CMYK:** Subtractive model using cyan, magenta, yellow, and black, primarily used for printing.
  - **HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value):** Represents color aligned with human perception, simplifying color selection in graphics software.
- **Color Lookup Table (CLUT):** A table that maps color indices to actual color values, used for reducing memory usage.
  - A mechanism for memory optimization by storing a limited color palette, referencing them through indices.
  - Beneficial for early graphics systems with limited resources, while potentially restricting the number of displayed colors.
