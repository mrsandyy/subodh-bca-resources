#### 3. Algorithm

**Definition**:  
An algorithm is a finite set of well-defined instructions performed in a specific sequence to solve a problem or perform a computation.

**Characteristics**:

- **Finiteness**: Must terminate after a finite number of steps.
- **Definiteness**: Each step must be precisely defined.
- **Input**: Takes zero or more inputs.

#### 4. Pseudocode

**Definition**:  
Pseudocode is a high-level description of an algorithm using simple and natural language, often resembling programming syntax.

**Example**:

```plaintext
BEGIN
   SET total to 0
   FOR each number in the list
       ADD number to total
   END FOR
   RETURN total
END
```

#### 5. Algorithm Analysis

Algorithm analysis helps in evaluating the efficiency of an algorithm, primarily focusing on resource usage.

1. **Time Complexity**:
   
   - Measures the time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of input size.
   - Common notations:
     - O(1): Constant time
     - O(n): Linear time
     - O(n²): Quadratic time

2. **Space Complexity**:
   
   - Evaluates the memory consumed by an algorithm during its execution.
   - Includes memory for:
     - Program instructions
     - Variables
     - Recursion stack

---

#### 6. Abstract Data Types (ADT)

**Definition**:  
An ADT is a mathematical model for data types where only behavior (operations) is defined, not implementation details.

**Examples**:

- **List ADT**: Operations include insertion, deletion, traversal.
- **Queue ADT**: Operations include enqueue, dequeue, peek.

#### 7. String Processing

**Definition**:  
String processing involves operations performed on sequences of characters.

1. **Basic Terminology**:
   
   - **String**: A finite sequence of characters.
   - **Substring**: A smaller sequence derived from a string.

2. **String Operations**:
   
   - **Concatenation**: Combining two strings.
   - **Substring Extraction**: Extracting a part of the string.

    for i in range(len(text) - len(pattern) + 1):
        if text[i:i+len(pattern)] == pattern:
            return i
    return -1
```

---

#### 8. Arrays

**Definition**:  
An array is a collection of elements stored in contiguous memory locations, each identified by an index.

1. **Representation in Memory**:
   
   - Array elements are stored sequentially.
   - Address of an element:  
     `Base Address + (Index × Size of each element)`

2. **Operations**:
   
   - **Insertion**: Adding an element.
   - **Deletion**: Removing an element.
   - **Searching**:
     - **Linear Search**: Sequentially checks each element.
     - **Binary Search**: Divides array and checks half.

**Example of Binary Search**:

```python
def binary_search(arr, x):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == x:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < x:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1
```

3. **Sorting**:
   - **Bubble Sort**:
     - Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.

**Example of Bubble Sort**:

```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
```

4. **Multidimensional Arrays**:
   
   - Arrays with more than one dimension.
   - Example: `Matrix = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]`

5. **Pointers and Pointer Arrays**:
   
   - Pointer: A variable that stores the address of another variable.
   - Pointer Array: An array of pointers pointing to other elements or arrays.

### UNIT II: Sorting and Linked Lists

---

#### 1. Sorting

Sorting refers to the process of arranging data in a specific order (ascending or descending). There are two categories of sorting:

1. **Internal Sorting**:
   
   - Sorting takes place entirely in the main memory (RAM).
   - Example algorithms: Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort.

2. **External Sorting**:
   
   - Involves sorting large amounts of data that cannot fit into the main memory.
   - Data is stored in external storage like disks, and only a small portion is loaded into memory at any time.
   - Example: Sorting large databases.

**Common Sorting Algorithms**:

- **Bubble Sort**: A simple algorithm where adjacent elements are compared and swapped until the entire list is sorted.
- **Insertion Sort**: Builds the sorted array one element at a time by inserting the next element into its correct position.
- **Selection Sort**: Repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted part and places it in the sorted part.
- **Merge Sort**: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the array into two halves, recursively sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves.
- **Quick Sort**: Another divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a 'pivot' element, partitions the array around the pivot, and recursively sorts the subarrays.
- **Radix Sort**: A non-comparative integer sorting algorithm that sorts numbers digit by digit, starting from the least significant digit.

---

#### 2. Linked Lists

A linked list is a linear data structure where elements (nodes) are stored in non-contiguous memory locations. Each node contains data and a reference (pointer) to the next node.

1. **Linked List vs Arrays**:
   
   - **Memory**: Linked lists do not require contiguous memory, unlike arrays. This makes them more flexible for dynamic data storage.
   - **Insertion/Deletion**: Insertion and deletion of elements can be done easily in a linked list as compared to arrays, where shifting of elements is required.
   - **Access time**: Arrays provide constant-time access, whereas linked lists provide linear-time access due to traversal.

2. **Types of Linked Lists**:
   
   - **Singly Linked List**: Each node points to the next node in the list. The last node points to `NULL`.
   - **Doubly Linked List**: Each node has two references: one to the next node and one to the previous node. This allows traversal in both directions.
   - **Circular Linked List**: The last node points back to the first node, creating a circular structure. It can be either singly or doubly circular.
   - **Doubly Circular Linked List**: A combination of doubly linked list and circular list, where the last node points to the first node and vice versa.

3. **Operations on Singly Linked List**:
   
   - **Insertion**: Add a new node at the beginning, end, or at a specified position.
   - **Deletion**: Remove a node from the beginning, end, or at a specified position.
   - **Traversal**: Visit each node in the list, typically used for displaying elements or searching.
   - **Searching**: Traverse the list to find a specific element.

### UNIT III: Stacks and Queues

---

#### 1. Stacks

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle, where the last element added is the first to be removed.

1. **Array and Linked List Representation of Stacks**:
   
   - **Array-based Stack**: Uses a fixed-size array to store elements. The top of the stack is represented by an index.
   - **Linked List-based Stack**: Uses a linked list where the top of the stack corresponds to the first node in the list.

2. **Operations on Stacks**:
   
   - **Push**: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
   - **Pop**: Removes the top element from the stack.
   - **Peek/Top**: Returns the top element without removing it.
   - **IsEmpty**: Checks if the stack is empty.

3. **Applications of Stacks**:
   
   - **Recursion**: Stacks are used in the implementation of recursive function calls.
   - **Polish Notation**: Stacks are used to evaluate expressions in Polish notation (prefix and postfix).

---

#### 2. Queues

A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle, where the first element added is the first to be removed.

1. **Array and Linked List Representation of Queues**:
   
   - **Array-based Queue**: Uses a circular array to store elements.
   - **Linked List-based Queue**: Uses a linked list where the front and rear pointers keep track of the beginning and end of the queue.

2. **Types of Queues**:
   
   - **Simple Queue**: Basic FIFO queue.
   - **Circular Queue**: The last element points to the first element, forming a circle. Helps in efficiently utilizing space.
   - **Priority Queue**: Each element is assigned a priority, and elements are dequeued in order of priority rather than arrival.
   - **Double Ended Queue (Deque)**: Allows insertion and deletion from both ends of the queue.

3. **Operations on Queues**:
   
   - **Enqueue**: Adds an element to the rear of the queue.
   - **Dequeue**: Removes an element from the front of the queue.
   - **Front/Peek**: Returns the element at the front without removing it.
   - **IsEmpty**: Checks if the queue is empty.

4. **Applications of Queues**:
   
   - **Scheduling**: Queues are used in job scheduling in operating systems.
   - **Buffering**: Queues are used in buffering data between producers and consumers in data streaming.
   - **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Queues are used to implement BFS in graph traversal.

### UNIT IV: Trees and Graphs

---

#### 1. Trees

A tree is a hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes connected by edges. It is widely used for representing relationships and hierarchies.

1. **Basic Tree Concepts**:
   
   - **Root**: The topmost node of a tree.
   - **Parent**: A node that has one or more child nodes.
   - **Child**: A node that is a descendant of another node.
   - **Leaf**: A node with no children.
   - **Subtree**: A tree formed by a node and all its descendants.

2. **Binary Trees**:
   
   - A binary tree is a tree in which each node has at most two children, typically referred to as the left and right children.
   - **Representation of Binary Tree in Memory**: Nodes are typically represented as objects with data and pointers to left and right children.

3. **Binary Tree Traversals**:
   
   - **In-order Traversal**: Left subtree → Root → Right subtree.
   - **Pre-order Traversal**: Root → Left subtree → Right subtree.
   - **Post-order Traversal**: Left subtree → Right subtree → Root.
   - **Level-order Traversal**: Traverses the tree level by level.

4. **Binary Search Trees (BST)**:
   
   - A binary tree where the left child is smaller than the parent, and the right child is larger.
   - Operations like searching, insertion, and deletion can be done in O(log n) time in a balanced BST.

5. **Heapsort**:
   
   - A comparison-based sorting algorithm based on a binary heap data structure.
   - Heaps are complete binary trees where each parent node is either greater than or less than its children (max-heap or min-heap).

---

#### 2. Graphs

A graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes (vertices) and edges (connections between nodes).

1. **Representations of Graphs**:
   
   - **Adjacency Matrix**: A 2D array where each cell indicates whether there is an edge between two nodes.
   - **Adjacency List**: A list where each node has a list of all nodes connected to it.

2. **Sequential Representation**:
   
   - A form of adjacency matrix or list representation where graph data is stored in a sequential manner for easier access.

3. **Warshall's Algorithm**:
   
   - A graph algorithm used to find the transitive closure of a directed graph, i.e., determining which vertices are reachable from others.

4. **Linked Representation of Graphs**:
   
   - In this representation, each vertex in the graph contains a list of adjacent vertices, typically implemented using linked lists.

5. **Operations on Graphs**:
   
   - **Insertion**: Add a vertex or an edge.
   - **Deletion**: Remove a vertex or an edge.
   - **Traversal**: Explore all the vertices and edges in a graph. Two common traversal methods are Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS).
